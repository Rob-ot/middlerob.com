    <div class="description">This was my pet project for about a year. It started with the idea of presenting the player with an empty table and a pile of cards and allowing them to play whatever card game they want. Players would be responsible for enforcing rules since there would be no built in restrictions. I ended up building a responsive widget system that works across mobile and desktop. Open the demo on your phone and computer at the same time to see it an action. Read more about it <a href="https://github.com/Rob-ot/Cards/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.</div>

I was in love. I played with JavaScript a lot in my free time and I finally made this Tetris-like game.</div>
